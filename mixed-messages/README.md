# Mixed Messages

## Instructions

For thir project, you build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You're welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.
